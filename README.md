## Overview

This is my first solution to the Frontend Mentor challenges. It's a basic card component with a top image, a heading and a paragraph, builded only with HTML5 and CSS3.

## My process

First, I created the structure in HTML. Then declarated the variables for colors, fonts and sizes. I't wasn't really necesary beacause it was a small challenge, but I wanted to buid it like it was a real project. I gived the body a `display:grid` to keep the footer in place and align the content. Then just aplied the styles.

I also used Photoshop to take some mesurements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Building the component wasn't hard. The **real challenge** was writing this README. I need to improve my english, and my redaction skills.

This little project was good for practising Git and getting more confident using the terminal.

### Continued development

I will continue with this challenges, they are great for practising and learning. Nex one will be [this one](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). I'm also learning Javascript, but I want to start with the easy ones first.
